# tfstat2tf
Generate a tf file from the tfstate file generated by terraform.

I imported it, so it's troublesome to post parameters to the tfstate file, so I made it.


**The generated tf file can hardly be used as it is. Please delete unnecessary parameters in `terraform plan`**
## Installation
```
go get -u github.com/int-tt/tfstate2tf
```

## Usage
```
$tfstate2tf < terraform.tfstate
```
